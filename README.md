Testing a TTS Model (Kokoro) integrated with an LLM (Llama 3) to test things out. If it works, can add it to sugar-speak activity with appropriate changes and better more suited models.

Kokoro model is running on localhost in a docker container. Its a docker container of a fork off kokoro (Kokoro-FastAPI). This let's me use openAI APIs to call kokoro from localhost via an API call

Llama is running and served locally via Ollama

Without both of these you won't be able to test it out locally. So if you want to try it out, do have these installed locally. 
This is just a trial run to see how things will work honestly
